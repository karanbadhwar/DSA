            Internally, these are also arrays.

            Stacks - Same when we use Recursion, functions calls keep getting pilled up on stack.
                    * In Stacks, what Comes in First is the last one to be removed.
                    * LIFO -> Last In First Out || FILO -> First In Last Out.
                    * Pop -> Removing an Item to the Stack && Push -> Adding an Item to the Stack

            Queue - Take it as an Example, as Line (People standing in Line).
                    * In Queues, what comes First is the First one to be removed.
                    * FIFO -> First In First Out || LILO -> Last In Last Out.

            Deque (Deck) - Doubly Ended Queue, can insert/Remove from both the sides.
