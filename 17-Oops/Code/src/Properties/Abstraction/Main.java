            Abstraction - Hiding the Unnecessary details and only showing valuable info.
            Abstraction works on the design level.

            Abstraction:
                Focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.
                Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
                Simplifies the complexity by providing a simplified model of the system.

            Encapsulation is the Internal Mechanics, while Abstraction is the External Part.
            Encapsulation handles the Internal Working, while Abstraction focuses on the Outer part.
