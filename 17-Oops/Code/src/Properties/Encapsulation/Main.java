            Encapsulation - Wrapping up the implementation of the data members and methods in a class.
            Encapsulation works on the internal level, how xyz is happening and how the data is wrapped up inside
             a group or part.

             Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).
              It involves bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a
              single unit, or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.
              This means that the internal state of the object is hidden from the outside world and can only be
              accessed through well-defined interfaces (methods).

              Encapsulation:
                Focuses on how the data is accessed and modified.
                Implement data hiding through access modifiers.
                Ensures that the internal state of an object is protected from unintended or harmful changes.

            Encapsulation is the Internal Mechanics, while Abstraction is the External Part.
            Encapsulation handles the Internal Working, while Abstraction focuses on the Outer part.

            Encapsulation is the process of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions or behaviors)
            that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. Encapsulation also involves using access
            modifiers to restrict access to the data.

            How Encapsulation Achieves Data Hiding: -
                Encapsulation uses access modifiers to control the visibility of the class members (attributes and methods).
                By making attributes private and providing public getter and setter methods,
                you hide the internal representation of the data and control how it is accessed and modified.
